      "p5": "We are not responsible for damages or accidents occurring due to driver impairment from alcohol, medication and/or drugs. The same applies to damages or accidents caused intentionally by the customer on- or off-road. In such cases, the customer is solely responsible.",

      "p8": "If this does not happen, the customer is responsible for all costs. Compliance with the traffic code lies solely with the renter and is NOT covered by insurance.

      "p10": "If additional damages occur under the same rental agreement, these are not covered by the comprehensive insurance and responsibility—including paying the deposit/excess amount—lies solely with the renter. The first damage is covered by comprehensive insurance with zero excess and at no extra cost to the renter. It is considered “first damage” only if the renter is at fault or if the culprit is not found. If the renter is not at fault, then it is not considered first damage.",
      "p11": "In case of a second or subsequent damage, insurance coverage remains in force, with all benefits still valid. However, collision damages to the rental vehicle and related repair costs are not covered. If the renter is at fault or the culprit cannot be identified, collision repairs are charged to the renter up to the amount of the resulting deposit. A refundable deposit is required, the amount of which depends on the vehicle category.",
      "p12": "Whether due to the renter’s fault or unknown fault, and if a replacement or continuation with the same vehicle is needed, the renter must pay or provide written acceptance for the activation of the excess, the amount corresponding to the vehicle category, as an excess guarantee.",
      "p13": "Pickup of the new vehicle will take place at our headquarters. Alternatively, by arrangement, delivery can be made elsewhere for an additional transfer fee. If not accepted, the rental is automatically terminated and no claim can be made against the company."
